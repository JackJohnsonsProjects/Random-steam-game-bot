# Random Steam Game Bot
A bot implemented using Discord4J, Selenium for web crawling and Jsoup for HTML parsing that gets all of the users Steam games and returns a random one to them, along with their total game amount, on the chat application Discord. Can be filtered by played or unplayed games and more information such as games played, percentage of games played and time spent in the game are shown with these filters.

Current version: Works but has issues.

## Commands:

!rgame [Custom URL/17 digit ID]

!rgame [Custom URL/17 digit ID] [played/unplayed]
